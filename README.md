# TheKakuroGame

A simple Java game where you can play, share and generate random kakuro boards.
Built as a university project along with 3 other developers (see about tab at login screen).

IMPORTANT:

  - Big kakuro boards may take longer to be generated, as well as hard boards may be slower than easier boards.
  
  - No database is used, everything is stored locally. Although we have made our best to re-generate deleted files, if you modify any of the generated files by the game
    we cannot ensure that it keeps working properly.
    
  - Once you finish playing a board you won't be able to play to that concrete board again. This is not a bug it has been implemented like this because as we have a ranking we         cannot permit users seeing the board's solution and then playing it again.
